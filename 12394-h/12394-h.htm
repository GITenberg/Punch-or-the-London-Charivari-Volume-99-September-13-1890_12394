    <h2>OUT FOR A HOLIDAY.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By our Impartial and Not-to-be-biassed
    Critic.</i>)</h4>

    <p>I had often been told that St. Margaret's Bay, between Deal
    and Dover, was lovely beyond compare. Seen from the Channel, I
    had heard it described as "magnificent," and evidence of its
    charms nearer at hand, was adduced in the fact that Mr. ALMA
    TADEMA, R.A., had made it his headquarters during a portion of
    the recent summer.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:20%;">
        <a href="images/121-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/121-1.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>So I determined to visit it. I had to take a ticket to
    Martin's Mill, a desolate spot, containing a railway station, a
    railway hotel, and (strange to say) a mill. I was told by an
    obliging official on my arrival, that St. Margaret's Bay was a
    mile and a half distant&mdash;"to the village." And a mile and
    a half&mdash;a very good mile and a half&mdash;it was! Up hill,
    down dale, along the dustiest of dusty roads, bordered by
    telegraph poles that suggested an endless lane without a
    turning. On climbing to the summit of each hill another long
    stretch of road presented itself. At length the village was
    reached, and I looked about me for the sea. A cheerful young
    person who was flirting with a middle-aged cyclist seemed
    surprised when I asked after it. "Oh, the sea!" she exclaimed,
    in a tone insinuating that the ocean was at a decided discount
    in her part of the world&mdash;"oh, you will find <i>that</i> a
    mile further on." I sighed wearily, and recommenced my plodding
    stumbles.</p>

    <p>I passed two unhappy-looking stone eagles protecting a
    boarding-house, and a shed given over to the sale of lollipops
    and the hiring of a pony-chaise. The cottages seemed to me to
    be of the boat-turned-bottom-upwards order of architecture, and
    were adorned with placards, announcing "Apartments to Let."
    Everything seemed to let, except, perhaps, the church, which,
    however (on second thoughts), appeared to be let alone. But if
    the houses were not, in themselves, particularly inviting,
    their names were pleasing enough, although, truth to tell, a
    trifle misleading. For instance, there was a "Marine Lodge,"
    which seemed a very considerable distance from the ocean, and a
    "Swiss <i>chalet</i>," that but faintly suggested the land
    renowned equally for mountains and merry juveniles. I did not
    notice any shops, although I fancy, from the appearance of a
    small barber's pole that I found in front of a cottage, that
    the hair-dressing interest must have had a local
    representative. For the rest, an air of hopefulness, if not
    precisely cheerfulness, was given to the place by the presence
    of a Convalescent Hospital. Leaving the village behind me, I
    came, footsore and staggering, at length to the Bay. I was
    cruelly disappointed. Below me was what appeared to be a small
    portion of Rosherville, augmented with two bathing-machines,
    and a residence for the Coast-guard. There was a hotel, (with a
    lawn-tennis ground), and several placards, telling of land to
    let. The descent to the sea was very steep, and, on the high
    road above it, painfully modern villas were putting in a
    disfiguring appearance. On the beach was a melancholy pic-nic
    party, engaged in a mild carouse. In the gloaming was a
    light-ship, marking the end of the Goodwin Sands.</p>

    <p>On a beautiful day no doubt St. Margaret's Bay would look
    quite as lovely as Gravesend, but when it rained I question
    whether it would compare favourably with Southend under similar
    atmospheric circumstances. There was some shrubbery creeping up
    the white hill-side that may have been considered artistic, and
    possibly the great expanse of ocean (when completely free from
    mist) had to a certain extent a sort of charm. As I looked
    towards the coast of France I had an excellent view of a
    steamer, crammed with (presumably) noisy excursionists, coming
    from Margate. But when I have said this I have nothing more to
    add, save that you can get from Martin's Mill to St. Margaret's
    Bay by an omnibus. By catching this conveyance you avoid a
    tedious walk, which puts you out of temper for the rest of the
    day.</p>

    <p>P.S.&mdash;I missed the omnibus!</p>

    <h3>Good Young "Zummerset!"</h3>

    <h4>(<i>Champion in Cricket of the Second-class
    Counties.</i>)</h4>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Eight matches played, and eight matches won!</p>

            <p><i>That</i>'s what none of the First-class Counties
            have done.</p>

            <p>'Tis clear that Young Zummerset knows "how to do
            it."</p>

            <p>Bravo, PALAIRET, WOODS, TYLER, ROE, HEWITT!</p>

            <p>Go on in this fashion, and soon you'll be
            reckoned</p>

            <p>Among the First-Classers, instead of the Second.</p>

            <p>Wet wickets this season, boys, seldom a rummer
            set,</p>

            <p>But they anyhow seem to have suited Young
            Zummerset!</p>

    <h2>THE REAL GRIEVANCE OFFICE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Before</i> Mr. COMMISSIONER PUNCH.)</h4>

    <blockquote>
        <p><i>A Medical Officer (with martial manner, and well set
        up) introduced.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>The Commissioner</i>. Well, Sir&mdash;may I call you
    Colonel?&mdash;what can I do for you?</p>

    <p><i>Medical Officer</i> (<i>smiling</i>). I am afraid, Sir,
    you may give me no military rank, as it would be contrary to
    the Regulations.</p>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> Have I not the pleasure of addressing a
    soldier?</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:18%;">
        <a href="images/121-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/121-2.png"
             alt="Mr. Commissioner Punch." /></a>
    </div>

    <p><i>Med. Off.</i> Well, yes, Sir, I suppose I may claim that
    title. I am an Army Surgeon, and in that capacity have not only
    to risk my life equally with my comrades in the field, but have
    to brave the additional danger inseparable from the fever-wards
    of a hospital. As a matter of fact many of my colleagues have
    earned the V.C., and not a few taken command when their aid was
    needed. I hope you have not forgotten ANTHONY HOME WYLIE and
    MACKINNON.</p>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> Certainly not&mdash;they are gallant
    fellows. Well, I am sorry to see you here, Doctor&mdash;what
    can I do for you?</p>

    <p><i>Med. Off.</i> I would ask your good services, Sir, to get
    us greater recognition in the Army. Pray understand we do not
    wish to be called Captain, Major, or Colonel, merely to
    "peacock" before civilians, but because, without official
    recognition of our true status, we are treated as inferior
    beings by the youngest subaltern in any battalion to which we
    may be attached.</p>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> Surely, Doctor, the title you have secured
    by scientific attainments, takes precedence of all others more
    easily obtained?</p>

    <p><i>Med. Off.</i> Possibly, in a College common-room, but not
    at a mess-table of a <i>d&eacute;p&ocirc;t</i> centre. That I
    express the general opinion of members of my profession is
    proved by the fact that it is shared by Sir ANDREW CLARK, the
    President of the Royal College of Physicians.</p>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> Well, what would you propose?</p>

    <p><i>Med. Off.</i> That we should be put on the same footing
    so far as rank is concerned, with officers in the Commissariat
    and other non-actively-combatant branches of the Army. We are
    merely fighting the fight fought years ago by another
    scientific corps, the Royal Engineers.</p>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> But surely, Doctor, the officers you have
    mentioned know something of their drill?</p>

    <p><i>Med. Off.</i> If that is the difficulty, let us make
    ourselves equally proficient. The more we are in touch with the
    so-called combatant officers the better.</p>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> Well, certainly, if you are good drills (and
    have some knowledge of the internal economy of a regiment, and
    the rudiments of military law) I cannot see why you should not
    enjoy the rank to which you aspire. I wish you every success in
    your application. After all, you are masters of the situation.
    If your superior officers are unreasonable&mdash;physic
    them!</p>

    <h4>AT A COUNTRY HOUSE.</h4>

    <p>"<i>So glad you have a fine day for your garden-party. Was
    quite anxious about the weather;</i>" <i>i.e.</i>, "Hoped
    sincerely it would rain hard&mdash;hate
    garden-parties&mdash;can't think why I'm here."</p>

    <p>"<i>How good of you to undertake such a long drive!</i>"
    <i>i.e.</i>, "hoped it would choke her off."</p>

    <p>"<i>So sweet of you to have brought your dear children;</i>"
    <i>i.e.</i>, "Greedy little pigs!&mdash;gobble up everything
    before the real guests arrive."</p>

    <p>"<i>Must you</i> really <i>go?</i>" <i>i.e.</i>, "About
    time&mdash;you're the last but one."</p>

    <p>"<i>Now mind&mdash;this is Liberty Hall&mdash;I always think
    true hospitality is, letting people do just what they
    like;</i>" <i>i.e.</i>, "<i>If</i> he's late for
    breakfast&mdash;and IF he shirks driving with Mrs. MORSON!"</p>

    <p>"<i>We lunch at half-past one. But don't trouble to be
    punctual. Quite a moveable feast;</i>" <i>i.e.</i>, "If he's
    unpunctual, he won't forget it."</p>

    <p>"<i>Such a lovely drive I want to take you this
    afternoon;</i>" <i>i.e.</i>, "<i>Must</i> pay that call
    to-day."</p>

    <p>"<i>Going to-morrow? Oh</i>, do <i>stay&mdash;we had looked
    forward to quite a week more.</i> Can't <i>you alter it?</i>"
    <i>i.e.</i>, "Quite safe. Know he's <i>got</i> to go."</p>

    <p>"<i>Such a sweet girl to have in the house!</i>"
    <i>i.e.</i>, "Slaves for her from morning till night."</p>

    <h2>WARE SNAKE!</h2>

    <p>Says Professor Alfred Marshall, of Cambridge, the great
    English Economist, in his luminous Address at the British
    Association meeting:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Every year economic problems become more difficult,
        every year it is more manifest that we need to have more
        knowledge and to get it soon, in order to escape, on the
        one hand, from the cruelty and waste of irresponsible
        competition and the licentious use of wealth, and, on the
        other, from the tyranny and the spiritual death of an
        iron-bound Socialism."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Here be judicial truths, skilfully <i>Marshalled</i> into
    clear order, which may profitably be noted by the angry
    sciolistic skirmishers on one side and the other in the great
    Social War now raging.</p>

    <p>The sniffing <i>Laissez-faire</i> man, the high and dry
    Economist, shrieks at the enthusiastic humanitarian Socialist,
    whom he would fain send to Anticyra,&mdash;or further; the
    headlong humanitarian Socialist howls at the high and dry
    Economist, whom he would like to despatch finally to Saturn, or
    "haply to some lower level," as BOB LOWE's epitaph had it. The
    result is cantankerous charivari!</p>

    <p>Marshall does more and better. He emphasises "the cruelty
    and waste of irresponsible competition," he admits "the
    licentious use of wealth," but he also recognises "the tyranny
    and the spiritual death of an iron-bound Socialism," that
    violent and venomous form of Socialism, which <i>Mr. Punch</i>
    this week has represented under the apt symbol of a clinging,
    hampering, and suffocating Serpent.</p>

    <p>Let the impetuous zealots who may probably demur to <i>Mr.
    Punch's</i> symbol&mdash;misunderstanding it&mdash;ponder
    Professor MARSHALL's words, and be not precipitate in judgment.
    There is Socialism <i>and</i> Socialism. The sort pictured by
    Professor MARSHALL, and <i>Mr. Punch</i>, is, like the Serpent
    of Old Myth, not the would-be friend of labour-cursed mankind,
    but a deceiving and glosingly deadly "incarnation of the

    <h2>CUPID AND MINERVA.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Fragment from an Autobiography that it is hoped will
    never be written.</i>)</h4>

    <p>I was most anxious that my past should be concealed from
    him, as I felt that once revealed, it would come between us as
    a barrier for ever! So I dissembled. I adapted my conversation
    to his capabilities. I learned to talk of lawn tennis, cricket,
    politics, even cookery. Only on one occasion did I betray
    myself. With self-abasement I was asking for an explanation of
    the electric telegraph. He gave me a somewhat faulty
    definition.</p>

    <p>"Dear me!" I cried. "How did they ever come to think of such
    a clever thing?"</p>

    <p>"<i>Omne ign[)o]tum pro magnifico</i>," he replied, with
    condescension.</p>

    <p>I could not bear the false quantity even from <i>his</i>
    lips, and I asked, "Would not <i>ign[=o]tum</i> be better,
    darling?"</p>

    <p>I could have bitten out my tongue for such an indiscretion.
    He looked at me sharply, with a glance of covert distrust.</p>

    <p>"What do <i>you</i> know about it?" he asked, somewhat
    brusquely.</p>

    <p>"Nothing, nothing!" I said, confusedly. "I happened to be
    looking through an Explanatory Pronouncing Dictionary of Latin
    Quotations, and found the passage."</p>

    <p>"Beware of consulting text-books," he returned,
    sententiously. "A little knowledge is a dangerous thing."</p>

    <p>For the moment I was safe, but I knew that the confidence
    that hitherto had existed between us was shaken and lessened.
    When he left me that day, he referred once more to the
    incident.</p>

    <p>"Forgive me, SCHOLASTICA, I know I have been disagreeable.
    But I confess I am upset&mdash;the fact is a man doesn't care
    to be picked up sharp in his Latin."</p>

    <p>"Forgive me!" I pleaded, "and you will love me?"</p>

    <p>"<i>Ad f[)i]nem</i>!" he returned, making the first vowel
    short. I set my teeth and was silent. He looked at me with a
    keen glance, as if he would read my very soul, murmuring under
    his breath, "if she will stand <i>that</i>, she will stand
    anything," and we parted! Once alone, I gave vent to my
    feelings in a burst of passionate weeping. "<i>Ad
    f&iuml;nem</i>!" Oh, it was hard to bear!</p>

    <p>At length the day arrived for our marriage. Just as I was
    starting for the Church a letter was handed to me. I recognised
    in the shaky superscription (which seemed to tremble in every
    stroke) his handwriting. The envelope contained a printed
    paper! It was the Oxford Class List! Then the truth in all its
    hideousness dawned upon me. He knew at last that I had taken a
    Double First!</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>This occurred many years ago. Well, time has brought its
    compensating comforts, and I am at least able to exclaim,
    "<i>Quum multa injusta ac prava fiunt moribus!</i>" without
    being guilty of using a false quantity!</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p>In consequence of the taking in or taking out of Nobodies'
    luggage, the train had been considerably delayed, and this
    delay had been protracted by the thirsty condition of the
    panting and enfeebled engine. Stopping to water the horses in
    the olden days took much less time, I should imagine, than
    stopping to supply the engine with water in our own day. Be
    this as it may, the stoppages had already been considerable,
    and the Baron was ruminating on the best method of passing his
    valuable time for the next two hours, when it occurred to him
    that in his bag he had been carrying about for some time past
    three books, in the hope that there might occur some
    opportunity, of which the Baron could avail himself, to peruse
    these works, and remark upon them for the benefit of the select
    reading public. He took up the first, read a few sketches of
    <i>Our Churchwardens</i>, but failing to appreciate the
    subject, returned it to the bag, and went in for
    <i>Monsignor</i>. Perhaps the weak state of health in which our
    engine found itself, had not been improved by the additional
    weight imposed on it, owing to having to carry
    <i>Monsignor</i>. "Uncommonly heavy," said the Baron, when he
    arrived at the hundredth page; "I will keep it in reserve for
    my lighter and gayer moments, when timely repression may be
    necessary." So saying, he restored this to the same receptacle,
    and made another dip in the lucky bag. This time he brought to
    the surface <i>The Case of George Candlemas</i>, by GEORGE
    SIMS. Very nearly giving it up was the Baron, on account of its
    title, so suggestive of the usual vein of shilling shockers,
    and very glad is he that he did not do so, as for the next hour
    and a quarter not only was the Baron really interested, but
    highly amused, and it would have done the heart of GEORGE SIMS,
    of <i>Horrible London</i> and other emotional tales, good to
    have seen the Baron chuckling over this capital short story,
    which is as ingenious as it is genuinely droll. It belongs to
    the same genus as the <i>Danvers Jewels</i>, though, in this
    latter, the idea of the character of the narrator is more
    humorously conceived than is Mr. SIMS's Baronet who acts as an
    amateur detective. The Baron highly recommends this story, as
    he also does a short tale in <i>Blackwood</i>, for this month,
    entitled, <i>A Physiologist's Wife</i>, by A. CONAN DOYLE.</p>

    <p>The Baron's attention has been turned to five little volumes
    of <i>Love Tales</i>, English, Irish, Scotch, American, and
    German. They form a companion set to <i>Weird Tales</i>,
    published also by PATERSON &amp; Co., and a pocketable size,
    most useful for travellers.</p>

    <p><i>A propos</i> of Travellers, why does not some English
    firm bring out a series of Guide-books, of the size, and
    written in the style of the <i>Guides Conty</i>, which, for
    travelling in France, are far and away the best Guide-books I
    know. The <i>Guides Joanne</i> are of course good, steady,
    trustworthy Guides, but they don't attract the traveller's
    attention to out-of-the-way places, and to the "things to do,"
    in the same pleasant way as do the writers in the <i>Guides
    Conty</i>. Where to go, when to go, how to go, how to make the
    most of a short visit, what to ask for, what to look for, what
    to take, and what to avoid, these are details for which the
    <i>Guides Conty</i> go in. They might be better, perhaps, in
    the way of maps, but this is a fault of all Guides. Wishing,
    when at Havre, to visit Merville-sur-Mer, and the celebrated
    Corneville, with whose <i>cloches</i> we are all acquainted, in
    vain I searched the ordinary maps, and at last found quite a
    microscopical place, and without the "Sur Mer," as there wasn't
    room for it in a map of either the <i>Guide Joanne</i> or
    <i>Conty</i>, I forget which. Why it seems to be generally
    ignored I don't know, but in this respect it is a
    fellow-sufferer with Westgate-on-Sea, whose name is on no
    sign-post that ever I've seen in the Island of Thanet, though
    it may by this time figure on some recent maps. The village of
    "Garlinge," which is on the inland side of the L.C.&amp;D.
    line, is to be found on every direction-post and on every map,
    and the fashionable Westgate is, so to speak, nowhere. BARON DE
    BOOK-WORMS.</p>

    <p>P.S.&mdash;Just attempted to read RUDYARD KIPLING's <i>On
    Greenhow Hill</i>, in this month's <i>Macmillan</i>. No doubt
    very clever, and will be greatly admired by Kiplingites, but,
    for me, time is too valuable and life too short to study and
    appreciate it. I can't even read it: <i>dommage</i>, but I
    can't.</p>

    <p>In this month's number of <i>The Cabinet Portrait
    Gallery</i> (CASSELL &amp; CO.) there is one of the best
    photographs of JOHN MORLEY I ever remember to have seen. Not
    easy to take: this one is by DOWNEY. No mistaking a photo by
    DOWNEY, and this one of JOHN MORLEY, the Nineteenth Century ST.
    JUST, has a thoroughly downy look about the face. Those of Lady
    DUDLEY and Sir FREDERICK LEIGHTON are not up to the DOWNEY
    standard, specially Lady DUDLEY's.</p>

    <p>In the <i>Fortnightly</i> Mr. FRANK HARRIS has induced Mr.
    W.S. LILLY to give us some personal reminiscences of Cardinal
    NEWMAN, together with some letters of the Cardinal's to him.
    Interesting, but too brief. Oddly enough, <i>&agrave;
    propos</i> of "Reminiscences," there is in this same Number a
    very amusing article by J.M. BARRIE on the manufacturing of
    reminiscences. Very droll idea. "Read it," says the Baron.</p>

    <p>In the <i>Contemporary</i> Mr. WILFRID MEYNELL gives an
    interesting Memoir of the great Cardinal and his
    contemporaries, and Mr. RUDYARD KIPLING writes a tale entitled
    <i>The Enlightenment of Mr. Padgett, M.P.</i>&mdash;of which
    more when I've read it. * * * I have read it. It isn't a story,
    so I was disappointed, and about as interesting to a
    story-seeker as <i>The National Congress</i>, of which it
    treats, to the majority of the Indian natives. But the dialogue
    is instructive and amusing, and will enlighten many Padgetts.

    <p><i>Sightseers discovered drifting languidly along in a state
    of depression, only tempered by the occasional exercise of the
    right of every free-born Briton to criticise whenever he fails
    to understand. The general tone is that of faintly amused and

    <p><i>A Burly Sightseer, with a red face</i> (<i>inspecting
    group representing "Mithras Sacrificing a Bull"</i>). H'm; that
    may be MITHRAS's notion o' making a clean job of it, but it
    ain't <i>mine</i>!</p>

    <p><i>A Woman</i> (<i>examining a fragment from base of
    sculptured column with a puzzled expression, as she reads the
    inscription</i>). "Lower portion of female
    figure&mdash;probably a Bacchante." Well, how they know who
    it's intended for, when there ain't more than a bit of her
    skirt left, beats <i>me</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Her Companion</i>. Oh, I s'pose they've got to put a name
    to it of <i>some</i> sort.</p>

    <p><i>An Intelligent Artisan</i> (<i>out for the day with
    his</i> Fianc&eacute;e&mdash;<i>reading from pedestal</i>).
    "Part of a group of As-Astrala&mdash;no,
    As<i>traga</i>&mdash;lizontes"&mdash;that's what <i>they</i>
    are, yer see.</p>

    <p><i>Fianc&eacute;e</i>. But who <i>were</i> they?</p>

    <p><i>The I.A.</i> Well, I can't tell yer&mdash;not for
    certain; but I expect they 'd be the people who in'abited
    Astragalizontia.</p>

    <p><i>Fianc&eacute;e</i>. Was that what they used to call
    Ostralia before it was discovered? (<i>They come to the Clytie
    bust.</i>) Why, if that isn't the same head Mrs. MEGGLES has
    under a glass shade in her front window, only smaller&mdash;and
    hers is alabaster, too! But fancy them going and copying it,
    and I daresay without so much as a "by your leave," or a "thank
    you!"</p>

    <p><i>The I.A.</i> (<i>reading</i>). "Portrait of ANTONIA,
    sister-in-law of the Emperor TIBERIUS, in the character of
    Clytie turning into a sunflower."</p>

    <p><i>Fianc&eacute;e</i>. Lor! They did queer things in those
    days, didn't they? (<i>Stopping before another bust.</i>) Who's
    that?</p>

    <p><i>The I.A.</i> 'Ed of Ariadne.</p>

    <p><i>Fianc&eacute;e</i> (<i>slightly surprised</i>).
    What!&mdash;not young ADNEY down our street? I didn't know as
    he'd been took in stone.</p>

    <p><i>The I.A.</i> How do you suppose they'd 'ave young ADNEY
    in among this lot&mdash;why, that's antique!</p>

    <p><i>Fianc&eacute;e</i>. Well, I was <i>thinking</i> it looked
    more like a female. But if it's meant for old Mr. TEAK, the
    shipbuilder's daughter, it flatters her up considerable; and,
    besides, <i>I</i> always understood as her name was BETSY.</p>

    <p><i>The I.A.</i> No, no; what a girl you are for getting
    things wrong! that 'ed was cut out years and years ago!</p>

    <p><i>Fianc&eacute;e</i>. Well, she's gone off <i>since</i>,
    that's all; but I wonder at old Mr. TEAK letting it go out of
    the family, instead of putting it on his mantelpiece along with
    the lustres and the two chiny dogs.</p>

    <p><i>The I.A.</i> (<i>with ungallant candour</i>). 'Ark at
    you! Why, you ain't much more sense nor a chiny dog
    yourself!</p>

    <p><i>Moralising Matron</i> (<i>before the Venus of Ostia</i>).
    And to think of the poor ignorant Greeks worshipping a
    shameless hussey like that; it's a pity they hadn't someone to
    teach them more respectable notions! Well, well! it ought to
    make us thankful <i>we</i> don't live in those benighted times,
    that it ought!</p>

    <p><i>A Connoisseur</i> (<i>after staring at a colossal Greek
    lion</i>). A lion, eh? Well, it's another proof to my mind that
    the ancients hadn't got very far in the statuary line. Now, if
    you <i>want</i> to see a stone lion done true to Nature, you've
    only to walk any day along the Euston Road.</p>

    <p><i>A Practical Man</i>. I dessay it's a fine collection
    enough, but it's a pity the things ain't more perfect. <i>I</i>
    should ha' thought, with so many odds and ends and rubbish
    lying about as is no use to nobody at present, they might ha'
    used it up in mending some that only requires a arm 'ere, or a
    leg there, or a 'ed and what not, to make 'em as good as ever.
    But ketch <i>them</i> (<i>he means the Officials</i>) taking
    any extra trouble if they can help it!</p>

    <p><i>His Companion</i>. Ah, but yer see it ain't so easy
    fitting on bits that belonged to something different. You've
    got to look at it <i>that</i> way!</p>

    <p><i>The P.M.</i> <i>I</i> don't see no difficulty about it.
    Why, any stonemason could cut down the odd pieces to fit well
    enough, and they wouldn't have such a neglected appearance as
    they do now.</p>

    <p><i>A Group has collected round a Gigantic Arm in red
    granite.</i></p>

    <p><i>First Sightseer</i>. There's a <i>arm</i> for yer!</p>

    <p><i>Second S.</i> (<i>a humorist</i>). Yes; 'ow would yer
    like to 'ave <i>that</i> come a punching your 'ed?</p>

    <p><i>Third S.</i> (<i>thoughtfully</i>). I expect they've put
    it up 'ere as a sample, like.</p>

    <p><i>The Moralising Matron</i>. How it makes one realise that
    there were giants in those days!</p>

    <p><i>Her Friend</i>. But surely the size must be a
    <i>little</i> exaggerated, don't you think? Oh, is <i>this</i>
    the God Ptah?</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>The</i> M.M. <i>says nothing, but clicks her tongue
        to express a grieved pity, after which she passes
        on.</i></p>

    <p><i>The</i> Intelligent Artisan <i>and his</i> Fianc&eacute;e
    <i>have entered the Nineveh Gallery, and are regarding an
    immense human-headed winged bull.</i></p>

    <p><i>The I.A.</i> (<i>indulgently</i>). Rum-looking sort o'
    beast that ere.</p>

    <p><i>Fianc&eacute;e</i>. Ye-es&mdash;I wonder if it's a
    likeness of some animal they used to 'ave then?</p>

    <p><i>The I.A.</i> I <i>did</i> think you was wider than
    <i>that</i>!&mdash;it's on'y imaginative. What 'ud be the good
    o' wings to a bull?</p>

    <p><i>Fianc&eacute;e</i> (<i>on her defence</i>). You think you
    know so much&mdash;but it's got a man's 'ed, hain't it? and I
    know there used to be <i>'orses</i> with 'alf a man where the
    'ed ought to be, because I've seen their pictures&mdash;so
    there!</p>

    <p><i>The I.A.</i> I dunno what you've got where <i>your</i>
    'ed ought to be, torking such rot!</p>

    <h4>IN THE UPPER GALLERIES; ETHNOGRAPHICAL COLLECTION.</h4>

    <p><i>A Grim Governess</i> (<i>directing a scared small boy's
    attention to a particularly hideous mask</i>). See, HENRY,
    that's the kind of mask worn by savages!</p>

    <p><i>Henry</i>. Always&mdash;or only on the fifth of November,
    Miss GOOLE?</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>He records a mental vow never to visit a Savage
        Island on Guy Fawkes' Day, and makes a prolonged study of
        the mask, with a view to future nightmares.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>A kind, but dense Uncle</i> (<i>to Niece</i>). All these
    curious things were made by cannibals, ETHEL&mdash;savages who
    eat one another you know.</p>

    <p><i>Ethel</i> (<i>suggestively</i>). But, I suppose, Uncle,
    they wouldn't eat one another if they had anyone to give them
    <i>buns</i>, would they?</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Her Uncle discusses the suggestion elaborately, but
        without appreciating the hint; the</i> Governess <i>has
        caught sight of a huge and hideous Hawaiian Idol, with a
        furry orange-coloured head, big mother-o'-pearl eyes, with
        black balls for the pupils, and a grinning mouth picked out
        with shark's teeth, to which she introduces the
        horrified</i> HENRY.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Miss Goole</i>. Now, HENRY, you see the kind of idol the
    poor savages say their prayers to.</p>

    <p><i>Harry</i> (<i>tremulously</i>). But n-not just before
    they go to bed, do they, Miss GOOLE?</p>

    <h4>AMONG THE MUMMIES.</h4>

    <p><i>The Uncle</i>. That's King RAMESES' mummy, ETHEL.</p>

    <p><i>Ethel</i>. And what was <i>her</i> name, Uncle?</p>

    <p><i>The Governess</i> (<i>halting before a cast containing a
    partially unrolled mummy, the spine and thigh of which are
    exposed to view</i>). Fancy, HENRY, that's part of an Egyptian
    who has been dead for thousands of years! Why, you're not
    <i>frightened</i>, are you?</p>

    <p><i>Harry</i> (<i>shaking</i>). No, I'm not frightened, Miss
    GOOLE&mdash;only, if you don't mind, I&mdash;I'd rather see a
    gentleman not <i>quite</i> so dead. And there's one over there
    with a gold face and glass eyes, and he looked at me,
    and&mdash;and please, I <i>don't</i> think this is the place to
    bring such a little boy as me to!</p>

    <p><i>A Party is examining a Case of Mummied Animals.</i></p>

    <p><i>The Leader</i>. Here you are, you see, mummy
    cats&mdash;don't they look comical all stuck up in a row
    there?</p>

    <p><i>First Woman</i>. Dear, dear&mdash;to think o' going to
    all that expense when they might have had 'em stuffed on a
    cushion! And monkeys, and dogs too&mdash;well, I'm sure, fancy
    <i>that</i>, now!</p>

    <p><i>Second Woman</i>. And there's a mummied crocodile down
    there. I <i>don't</i> see what they 'd want with a mummy
    <i>crocodile</i>, do you?</p>

    <p><i>The Leader</i> (<i>with an air of perfect comprehension
    of Egyptian customs</i>). Well, you see, they took whatever
    they could get 'old of, <i>they</i> did.</p>

    <h4>IN THE PREHISTORIC GALLERY.</h4>

    <p><i>Old Lady</i> (<i>to</i> Policeman). Oh, Policeman, can
    you tell me if there's any article here that's supposed to have
    belonged to ADAM?</p>

    <p><i>Policeman</i> (<i>a wag in his way</i>). Well, Mum, we
    <i>'ave</i> 'ad the 'andle of his spade, and the brim of his
    garden 'at, but they wore out last year and 'ad to be thrown
    away&mdash;things won't last for ever&mdash;even <i>'ere</i>,
    you know.</p>

    <h4>GOING OUT.</h4>

    <p><i>A Peevish Old Man</i>. I ain't seen anything to call
    worth seeing, <i>I</i> ain't. In our museum at 'ome they've a
    lamb with six legs, and hairylight stones as big as
    cannon-balls; but there ain't none of that sort 'ere, and I'm
    dog-tired trapesing over these boards, I am!</p>

    <p><i>His Daughter</i> (<i>a candid person</i>). Ah, I ought to

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
